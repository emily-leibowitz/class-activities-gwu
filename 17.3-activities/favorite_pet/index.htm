                <h1>Higgins is Adorable</h1>
                <p><img src="images/hig2.png">Higgins is a silly little dog. He only has two settings: on and off. Either he's running around at a million miles per hour or snoozing the day away. A true Greyhound in miniature, the elegant Italian Greyhound is an alert, playful, and highly affectionate toy companion. IGs make decorative couch dogs, but at heart they are flash-and-dash coursing hounds with an instinct for pursuit. IGs are Greyhounds in miniature more slender, but a Greyhound's equal in grace and elegance. Standing ideally 13 to 15 inches at the shoulder, they present the sleek, curving lines common to all coursing hounds. Distinguishing features are the long, fine-boned legs. IGs combine the attentiveness of lapdogs with the complexity of ancient, aristocratic hounds. Bred for centuries to be doting companions and jesters, these high-stepping charmers refuse to be ignored.'On the whole,'writes an IG expert,'the breed would much rather be in your lap or bed than on the floor.The Italian Greyhound is an Italian breed of small sighthound. It may also be called the Italian Sighthound. Temperament: Mischievous, Intelligent, Affectionate, Agile, Companionable, Athletic Colors: Black, Fawn, Blue Fawn, Chocolate, Tan, Sable, Red Fawn, Blue, Slate Grey, Grey, Red, Yellow</p>
